A very good approximations for these reference elements based on the TESS data you are working are provided in both $dvs$ and $dvm$ files that you should have downloaded together with your TESS data. (Those pdf files in the same directory of your $FITS$ files). In those files, a mid-transit time (in TESS BJD-TDB, which is 2457000. less than the real BJD-TDB) and an orbital period are actually provided. Let's look at such a file below for our sample case HAT-P-36 b. The required reference elements are in the red box!\n",
