# tess_data_analysis

Jupyter notebooks to cut TESS light curves and analyze TESS target pixel files as well as SAP, PDCSAP and DVT light curves.

The information on how to use the codes is provided in detail within the Jupyter notebooks. The codes have been provided especially to the observers & researchers working in the project titled "Exoplanet Discovery with the Timing Technique" funded by TUBITAK with the project number 118F042. However, anyone interested in the code are welcome to use it and provide feedback. Nevertheless, the code has no error-handling unfortunately. So you are at your own risk. You have to enter the information correctly. Otherwise it crashes! If an unexpected error occur please let us know and we will correct the code if the error is some bug or direct you otherwise.
